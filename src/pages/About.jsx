            Here at (insert generic company name), we are all about money,
            that's it, all we care is reselling the cheapest goods, something
            you will only buy because it's cheap and it may be fun for a couple
            of seconds after unboxing it but that's it. And you know that feels
            good so you'll come back for another hit, ain't that fun? Anyway,
